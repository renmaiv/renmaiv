## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

That shouldâ€™ve been a typical abandoned account â€” last time I posted something was 9 years ago! Life happened, but a lot might change soon.

What are my niche interests?

- SVG/GSAP (old talk on Web Standards Days)
- Smart UI microinteractions
- Production-ready tools


Revitalising in 2026:

A timeline of design culture snapshots and stories across countries â€” so you could compare, say, US vs. Taiwanese vs. Moroccan product design. It was called Limelapse.

Always on look out for mentors on ML/AI, expressive AI, graphs or simply for a chat.
