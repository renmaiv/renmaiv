## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



What are my interests?

- SVG/GSAP 
- Smart UI microinteractions
- Production-ready tools


Revitalising in 2026:

A timeline of design culture snapshots and stories across countries â€” so you could compare, say, US vs. Taiwanese vs. Moroccan product design. It was called Limelapse.

Always on look out for mentors on ML/AI, expressive AI, graphs or simply for a chat.
